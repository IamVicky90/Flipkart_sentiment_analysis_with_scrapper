headphone,Mobin Mohammad,2,Expected a better product,These earphones are pretty basic yet they fail to provide the bare minimum one expects from budget oriented earphones. Boat is known for its bass and sturdy built quality and both were missing in this model. The wire length of the earphones are small and  doesn't provide the extra freedom to move whem plugged in. BOTTOM LINE put few more bucks and go for basshead 225 or 220 or if you are short on cash Flipkart smart buy basic earphones are still better than this one.READ MORE

Comfortable fit as you intend to use them for longer duration2. Battery life- an obvious thing3. Good Call qualityBoat Airdopes 381 ticks all of those boxes in a decent proportion.

headphone,Gopesh Sharma,3,Just okay,"I switched to these from my sennheiser earphones. There is good bass no doubt but the quality of sound is not up to the mark.It totally depends on your taste of music, if you only like to hear soft music then don't go for this product.i expect the company to make more improvement in the quality of sound. Overall, it won't be able to provide you with a magical experience of music but will work fine for someone who has not used sennheiser before, if you know what i mean... ;) .READ MORE"
