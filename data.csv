My Dad being a music lover claims that this is the best sound quality he had ever experienced on any other mobile device! Price could have better though. I still feel the product is overpriced even though I purchased for 54k after heavy discounts. But as long as my father is happy, all is forgiven! :)READ MORE",Adit Kapoor
